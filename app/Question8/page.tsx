              Only thing I would say is, there needs to be a bit more preface or more time when it comes to building a site. There is just a lot to consider and because code can be touchy and particular, code errors are bound to happen. Otherwise, I think this was a great exercise. I learned so much and we have some amazing minds here at Vercel.
